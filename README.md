# Restaurant-Page

Restaurant Page project from The Odin Project.

The lesson before this project covered webpacks and modules, so the aim here was to learn all those techniques and apply them to a simple restaurant page.

The background pictures were definitely a bit heavy, had something in mind but didn't apply it that well. 

The food images are AI generated using DALLÂ·E 2
